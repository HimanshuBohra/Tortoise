# Tortoise

# Things kept in mind while working on the solution :
1. Proper Validation for every Request that is being sent
2. REST API HTTP methods usage


# Validations: 
1. Datatype check
2. While creating promotions for plan the promotion start date and end date overlapping has been handled
3. While creating customer goals a User won't be able to opt for a single plan twice.

# Things I have considered will be present
1. User table will be present
2. While sending customer Goals POST request, the data has been validated with respective plan and promotion
